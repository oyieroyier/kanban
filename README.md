# A Simple Kanban APP (in Development)

## A user can:

1. Add planned tasks.
2. Drag the Tasks to the "Ongoing" column when they start working on them.
3. Drag the tasks to the "Done" column when they are done working on them.
4. Add a task to any of the columns.
5. Delete any of the tasks.

The app displays a status indicator depending on the status of the task:

- A calendar for Planned tasks.
- An hourglass animation for Ongoing tasks.
- A green checkmark for Done tasks. Done tasks are also crossed out with a strikethrough.
